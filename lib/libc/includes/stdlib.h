   null character). If base is 0, assume it to be 10, unless the integer
   representation starts with 0x / 0X (setting base to 16) or 0 (setting base to
   8). If given, base can be anything from 0 to 36, using the 26 letters of the
   base alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) as digits 10 through 35.
   The integer representation is then converted into the return type of the
   function. It can start with a '+' or '-' sign. If the sign is '-', the result
   of the conversion is negated.
   If the conversion is successful, the converted value is returned. If endptr
   is not a NULL pointer, a pointer to the first trailing invalid character is
   returned in *endptr.
   If no conversion could be performed, zero is returned (and nptr in *endptr,
   if endptr is not a NULL pointer). If the converted value does not fit into
   the return type, the functions return LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX, ULONG_MAX,

   the integer representation and the return type, and errno is set to ERANGE.
