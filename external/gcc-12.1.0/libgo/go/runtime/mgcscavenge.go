// Scavenging free pages.
//
// This file implements scavenging (the release of physical pages backing mapped
// memory) of free and unused pages in the heap as a way to deal with page-level
// fragmentation and reduce the RSS of Go applications.
//
// Scavenging in Go happens on two fronts: there's the background
// (asynchronous) scavenger and the heap-growth (synchronous) scavenger.
//
// The former happens on a goroutine much like the background sweeper which is
// soft-capped at using scavengePercent of the mutator's time, based on
// order-of-magnitude estimates of the costs of scavenging. The background
// scavenger's primary goal is to bring the estimated heap RSS of the
// application down to a goal.
//
// That goal is defined as:
//   (retainExtraPercent+100) / 100 * (heapGoal / lastHeapGoal) * last_heap_inuse
//
// Essentially, we wish to have the application's RSS track the heap goal, but
// the heap goal is defined in terms of bytes of objects, rather than pages like
// RSS. As a result, we need to take into account for fragmentation internal to
// spans. heapGoal / lastHeapGoal defines the ratio between the current heap goal
// and the last heap goal, which tells us by how much the heap is growing and
// shrinking. We estimate what the heap will grow to in terms of pages by taking
// this ratio and multiplying it by heap_inuse at the end of the last GC, which
// allows us to account for this additional fragmentation. Note that this
// procedure makes the assumption that the degree of fragmentation won't change
// dramatically over the next GC cycle. Overestimating the amount of
// fragmentation simply results in higher memory use, which will be accounted
// for by the next pacing up date. Underestimating the fragmentation however
// could lead to performance degradation. Handling this case is not within the
// scope of the scavenger. Situations where the amount of fragmentation balloons
// over the course of a single GC cycle should be considered pathologies,
// flagged as bugs, and fixed appropriately.
//
// An additional factor of retainExtraPercent is added as a buffer to help ensure
// that there's more unscavenged memory to allocate out of, since each allocation
// out of scavenged memory incurs a potentially expensive page fault.
//
// The goal is updated after each GC and the scavenger's pacing parameters
// (which live in mheap_) are updated to match. The pacing parameters work much
// like the background sweeping parameters. The parameters define a line whose
// horizontal axis is time and vertical axis is estimated heap RSS, and the
// scavenger attempts to stay below that line at all times.
//
// The synchronous heap-growth scavenging happens whenever the heap grows in
// size, for some definition of heap-growth. The intuition behind this is that
// the application had to grow the heap because existing fragments were
// not sufficiently large to satisfy a page-level memory allocation, so we
// scavenge those fragments eagerly to offset the growth in RSS that results.
