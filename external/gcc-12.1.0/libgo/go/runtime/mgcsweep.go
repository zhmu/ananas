// Garbage collector: sweeping

// The sweeper consists of two different algorithms:
//
// * The object reclaimer finds and frees unmarked slots in spans. It
//   can free a whole span if none of the objects are marked, but that
//   isn't its goal. This can be driven either synchronously by
//   mcentral.cacheSpan for mcentral spans, or asynchronously by
//   sweepone, which looks at all the mcentral lists.
//
// * The span reclaimer looks for spans that contain no marked objects
//   and frees whole spans. This is a separate algorithm because
//   freeing whole spans is the hardest task for the object reclaimer,
//   but is critical when allocating new spans. The entry point for
//   this is mheap_.reclaim and it's driven by a sequential scan of
//   the page marks bitmap in the heap arenas.
//
// Both algorithms ultimately call mspan.sweep, which sweeps a single
// heap span.
