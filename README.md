## Introduction

Ananas (pronounced as pineapple) is my operating system. It consists of a kernel, a loader, assorted builds scripts and a standard C library (which is based on the Public Domain C Library, PDCLib). Ananas has a clear goal: technology-wise to be the easiest-to-understand operating system in existance, and license-wise to be the most free operating system imaginable.

More information is available at [my website](https://rink.nu/projects/ananas.html), with some screenshots and whatnot.

## Getting started

In order to try Ananas or get hacking on it, you will need a Linux environment (I use Debian) with appropriate development tools (`sudo apt-get install build-essential` is a good start), Git, and a lot of spare time. Details instructions are in the doc/ folder, with [getting-started.txt](doc/getting-started.txt) being a good start.
